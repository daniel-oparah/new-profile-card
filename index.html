                <p>I am a stay-at-home guy from Nigeria. 
                    Professionally I’ve done quite a lot – a little bit of this,
                     a little bit of that. Until autumn  2022,
                      I lived in Nigeria and worked as a bet9ja cashier,
                     but I’ve also had a side hustle – trading forex 
                     but it wasn't going well so i had to quit. 
                    </p><br>
                    <p>in 2023 i gained admission into
                    a university to study computer science which 
                    have not resumed but i have decided 
                    to learn to programming before
                     i resume because i do enjoy coding</p><br>
                     <p>Why I’ve decided to learn to program ?
                         My friend really pushed me and encouraged me.
                          He persuaded me to go for it,
                         despite my hesitations
                          (what if I’m not going to make it?..)
                    </p>

                    <h2> <a href="">Title of the second blog</a></h2><br>
                    <h3>I returned to learning to code because
                        I’m hoping to make it
                         my career and profession
                    </h3>
                    <p>My decision was driven by the idea of 
                        making money from my career. 
                    This is what I feel I’m naturally quite good at. i pray i learn more and
                    things work out successfully.</p>
